2. See the kit user guide for more details on configuring the board.

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[Hello World](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-pmg1-hello-world)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *PMG1-CY7110* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id PMG1-CY7110 --app-id mtb-example-pmg1-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

1. Ensure that the steps listed in the [Hardware setup](#hardware-setup) section are completed.

2. Ensure that the jumper shunt on power selection jumper (J5) is placed at position 2-3 to enable programming.

3. Connect the board to your PC using the USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector (J1). This cable is used for programming the PMG1 device and as a USB-UART bridge to the PC during operation.

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=PMG1-CY7110 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

5. After programming the kit, disconnect the USB cable and change the position on the power selection jumper (J5) to 1-2 to power the kit through the USB PD port.

6. Connect the USB cable back to the KitProg3 USB connector and open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

7. Connect the USB PD port (J10) to a USB-C power adapter or your PC using a USB Type-C cable to power the PMG1 MCU.

8. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the kit LED is in ON state. The device is in Active state at this moment.

9. Press the kit button for approximately 200 ms and release it. The device will enter Sleep mode. Observe that the LED quickly blinks twice before entering Sleep mode. Press the button for less than 200 ms to wake up the device from Sleep mode and enter Active mode.

10. Press the kit button for at least two seconds and release it. The device will enter Deep Sleep mode. Observe that the LED quickly blinks three times before entering Deep Sleep mode. Button press for less than 200 ms will wake up the device from Deep Sleep mode and enter Active mode.

The UART terminal prints the current state of the device.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. Ensure that the board is connected to your PC using the USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector and the jumper shunt on power selection jumper (J5) is placed at position 1-2.

See the "Debug mode" section in the kit user guide for debugging the application on CY7110 prototyping kit. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

This example demonstrates how to transition PMG1 MCU between Sleep and Deep Sleep power modes. It uses a GPIO interrupt to wake up the device from Sleep and Deep Sleep modes. The firmware implements the state machine shown in the [Overview](#overview) section.

The device wakes up from low-power modes when a switch press is detected. An LED is connected to an output pin; it is used for indicating the current low-power state of the device. The firmware flow is as follows:

**Figure 2. Firmware flowchart**

<img src="images/flowchart.png" width="548" height="839">

1. Initialize the GPIO wakeup interrupt. An input pin, externally connected to a switch, is configured to generate an interrupt when the switch is pressed.

2. Enable the UART peripheral for printing the debug statements.

3. Two power management callback functions are registered (Deep Sleep and Sleep callbacks). Table 2 shows the actions of each callback function.

**Table 3. Callback functions**

| Callback | Power state | CHECK_READY | CHECK_FAIL | BEFORE_TRANSITION | AFTER_TRANSITION |
|----------|--------------| -----------| ----------- | --- | --- |
| deep_sleep_callback() | Deep Sleep | Disable UART | Enable the UART to operate | Quickly blinks the LED thrice  | Enable UART |
| sleep_callback() | Sleep | Disable UART | Enable the UART to operate | Quickly blinks the LED twice | Enable UART | |

Following are the current consumption measured in active, sleep and deepsleep mode. Note that this data is measured with specific setup and might vary. Refer to the corresponding datasheets to get accurate values.

**Table 4. PMG1 current consumption**

| Kits      | Active mode | Sleep mode | Deep sleep mode  |
| :-------  | :---------  | :--------  | :------------    |
| PMG1-S0   | 5.80mA      | 2.23mA     | 178.2uA          |
| PMG1-S1   | 6.25mA      | 2.36mA     | 315.1uA          |
| PMG1-S2   | 7.44mA      | 3.50mA     | 381.0uA          |
| PMG1-S3   | 9.31mA      | 4.05mA     | 237.9uA          |
